# Equestrian_Stables_WebApp

This is my Web Application Project, named "Equestrian Stables". 

My project needs some improvements, because it has to look good and still be mobile-friendly.
I've found a way to make it mobile-responsive too, but the pictures are not in good places (for example, some are smaller and the others are bigger). 
So, these are the changes that I made:
- In "style.css": lines 250 and 265 (You could see there what I've changed, because I wrote some comments).
